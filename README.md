# BitMap
## Task

There is given a rectangular bitmap of size n\*m. Each pixel of the bitmap is either white or black, but at least one is white. The pixel in i-th line and j-th column is called the pixel (i,j). The distance between two pixels p1=(i1,j1) and p2=(i2,j2) is defined as d(p1,p2)=|i1-i2|+|j1-j2|.

Write a program which:

- Reads the description of the bitmap from the standard input.
- For each pixel, computes the distance to the nearest white.
- writes the results to the standard output.

## Usage

### Running the code

#### Prerequisites
Node should be installed in the system

#### Execute the code by running the following command from console.
```
node BitMap.js
```
The above command will run several test cases on the solution
